The technique is the method(s) you have used to create the image on the surface. \nHere are some examples of the methods and techniques that can be used when creating a piece of \ngraphic media.\n- \nTraditional mark making\u00a0( pen, pencil, inking, painting, chalk, charcoal, markers)\n- \nDigital mark making ( digital painting in packages such as photoshop, illustrator, coral draw, coral \npainter)\n- \nDigital flat graphics\n- \n3D modelling ( rendered out into a 2d image )\n- \nAnimation (digital 2d, using flash and 3d using packages such as pencil 2d, 3DS max etc., traditional, \ndrawing individual frames using traditional mark making techniques)\nGraphic techniques\n\n", "Graphic technologies is the method that we use to create our graphic images, both traditional technologies and \ndigital technologies.\nTraditional Methods\n- Dry media (pencils, charcoal, chalk)\n- Wet media ( ink, marker, biro, brush pen, paint, watercolour, acrylics, oils, gouache)\n- Different types of paper and surface( newsprint for quick throwaway designs, drawing paper with thicker quality \nmore or less grain, watercolour paper very absorbent and grainy, marker paper absorbent and smooth, also has a \nplastic surface on one side to stop ink bleeding through, canvas rough/smooth thick and water resistant, board \nsimilar properties to canvas.)\n- Traditional film camera, to put an image from real life into traditional media.\n- Printer, to turn digital media into traditional media.\nGraphic technologies\n\n", " board \nsimilar properties to canvas.)\n- Traditional film camera, to put an image from real life into traditional media.\n- Printer, to turn digital media into traditional media.\nGraphic technologies\n\nGraphic media in Advertising\n- Graphic designs in marketing and advertising are used throughout the packaging, \nbrochures, logo creation, website design, display ads, and billboards. Graphic design plays \na crucial role in advertising. \n- The main goal is to create a visually appealing graphic that emphasizes the product or \nservice being offered. Graphic media in advertising uses visual elements to convey a \nmessage or promote a product. \n\nTYPES OF GRAPHIC \nMEDIA\n\n Graphic Media\n\u25e6When Represented digitally graphics media can be broadly \ncategorized into two types \n\u25e6Raster Graphics\n\u25e6Vector Graphics\n\nWHAT IS A RASTER IMAGE?\n- Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are \ncomprised of individual pixels of color. \n- Each color pixel contributes to the overall image.\n\n", "\u25e6Raster Graphics\n\u25e6Vector Graphics\n\nWHAT IS A RASTER IMAGE?\n- Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are \ncomprised of individual pixels of color. \n- Each color pixel contributes to the overall image.\n\n\u25e6Images are made up of pixels\n\nWHAT IS A RASTER \nIMAGE?\nRaster images\nare composed with a series of \nindividually- colored dots of paint.\nEach paint dot represent a single pixel in a raster image.\n\nWHAT IS A RASTER IMAGE?\nRaster images are\ncapable of rendering complex,\nmulti- colored visuals, including soft color gradients.\nDigital cameras\ncreate\nraster\nimages, and all the \nphotographs you see in print and online are raster images.\n\n", "re\ncapable of rendering complex,\nmulti- colored visuals, including soft color gradients.\nDigital cameras\ncreate\nraster\nimages, and all the \nphotographs you see in print and online are raster images.\n\n- Raster graphics, also called bitmap graphics,\u00a0is a type of digital image that uses tiny \nrectangular pixels, or picture elements, arranged in a grid formation to represent an \nimage.\n- A raster graphic is made up of a collection of tiny, uniformly sized pixels, which are \narranged in a two-dimensional grid made up of columns and rows. \n- Each pixel contains one or more bits of information, depending on the degree of \ndetail in the image. For example, a black-and-white image contains only one bit per \npixel (a binary bit can be in one of two states; thus, a single bit can represent white or \nblack); an image with shading and colour commonly contains 24 bits of information \nper pixel - with 224, or more than 16 million, possible states per pixel.\nRaster Graphics\n\n", "t can represent white or \nblack); an image with shading and colour commonly contains 24 bits of information \nper pixel - with 224, or more than 16 million, possible states per pixel.\nRaster Graphics\n\nThe number of bits stored in each pixel is known as the bit depth. Each pixel consists \nof two or more colors. \nColor depth refers to\u00a0the amount of color that each pixel can display. It is measured \nby the number of colors each pixel in an image can show. The higher the color depth, \nthe more colors an image can display. Pixels store color information in a specific number \nof computer bits, ranging from one bit to 48 bits. Color depth is measured in bits per \npixel.\nThe number of pixels in a display, called resolution, affects how much detail can be \ndepicted in an image. Resolution is often expressed as the number of pixels in a column \ntimes the number of pixels in a row (for example, 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0600).\nColor depth/Bit depth and Resolution\n\n", "il can be \ndepicted in an image.

The DPI is set by the actual \nprinter device and it is not something in the image for the graphic designer to manipulate.\nPPI - Pixels per Inch\nDigital raster images are measured in pixels, or picture elements.

Your image must be at \nleast 1500 pixels wide.\n\nHOW TO DETERMINE WHAT DIMENSION YOUR \nIMAGE CAN BE PRINTED AT GOOD QUALITY?\nDivide the pixel dimension of your image by \nthe resolution required by your printer.\nFor example: If image is 1024 pixels wide & printer \nrequires 300 ppi (1024 \u00f7 300) = image can be \nprinted at 3.413\" wide.\n\nCalculate the size of a raster image\n\n", " resolution required by your printer.\nFor example: If image is 1024 pixels wide & printer \nrequires 300 ppi (1024 \u00f7 300) = image can be \nprinted at 3.413\" wide.\n\nCalculate the size of a raster image\n\nCAN WE ENLARGE THE PIXEL DIMENSION & \nRESOLUTION OF A RASTER IMAGE?\nOnce the image is created at a certain dimension, you may not be \nable to use this image at a larger size without losing quality. \nWhen you manually increase the resolution with a program like \nPhotoshop, Photoshop randomly adds pixels and the result will \nmost likely be a high resolution image of poor quality.\n\nProblems\n1.

Also, the amount of available hard\ndrive space would also pose a constraint, since audio files are so large.\n\n", "\u26abAll of these factors inhibited the widespread usage and availability of\na true multimedia experience.\n\u26abIn 1995, Progressive Networks (later renamed Real Networks)\nintroduced a new technology which solved many of the existing\nproblems with audio.

At it's most basic, equalization can mean\nturning the bass/treble controls up or down. Advanced equalizers\nhave fine controls for specific frequencies.\n\u26abModerate use of equalization (often abbreviated as \"EQ\") can be\nused to \"fine-tune\" the tone quality of a recording; extreme use of\nequalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create\nmore unusual effects.\n\u26abCommon uses for equalization include correct signals which sound\nunnatural and reducing feedback.\n\n", "e use of\nequalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create\nmore unusual effects.\n\u26abCommon uses for equalization include correct signals which sound\nunnatural and reducing feedback.\n\nFiltering\n\u26abEqualization is a form of filtering. In the general\nsense, frequency ranges can be emphasized or\nattenuated\nusing low-pass, high-pass, bandpass or band-stop filters. Band-pass filtering of voice\ncan simulate the effect of a telephone because\ntelephones use band-pass filters.\n\n", "an be emphasized or\nattenuated\nusing low-pass, high-pass, bandpass or band-stop filters. Band-pass filtering of voice\ncan simulate the effect of a telephone because\ntelephones use band-pass filters.\n\nCompression & Limiting\n\u26abCompression means reducing the dynamic range of a signal. All signal\nvalues above a certain adjustable threshold are reduced in gain\nrelative to lower-level signals. This creates a more even signal level,\nreducing the level of the loudest parts.\n\u26abLevel compression is not to be confused with audio data compression,\nwhere the amount of data is reduced without affecting the amplitude of\nthe sound it represents.\n\u26abLimiting is an extreme form of compression. Rather than smoothly\nreducing the gain of successively higher levels, all signal above the\nthreshold is limited to the same gain. This creates a very hard cut-off\npoint, over which there is no increase in level.\n\n", "moothly\nreducing the gain of successively higher levels, all signal above the\nthreshold is limited to the same gain. This creates a very hard cut-off\npoint, over which there is no increase in level.\n\nExpansion & Noise Gating\n\u26abExpansion means increasing the dynamic range of a signal.\nHigh level signals maintain the same (or nearly the same) levels,\nlow level signals are reduced (attenuated). This creates a\ngreater range between quiet and loud. Expansion is the opposite\nof compression.\n\u26abNoise gating is an extreme form of expansion  -  signals below a\ncertain\npoint\nare\neither\nheavily\nattenuated\nor\neliminated\ncompletely. This leaves only higher level signals and removes\nbackground noise when the signal is not present.\n\n", "expansion  -  signals below a\ncertain\npoint\nare\neither\nheavily\nattenuated\nor\neliminated\ncompletely. This leaves only higher level signals and removes\nbackground noise when the signal is not present.\n\nDelay / Echo\n\u26abDelay is a simple concept  -  the original audio signal is followed closely by a delayed\nrepeat, just like an echo. The delay time can be as short as a few milliseconds or as long\nas several seconds. A delay effect can include a single echo or multiple echoes, usually\nreducing quickly in relative level.\n\u26abDelay also forms the basis of other effects such as reverb, chorus, phasing and flanging.\n\u26abecho - to simulate the effect of reverberation in a large hall or cavern, one or\nseveral delayed signals are added to the original signal.\n\u26abTo be perceived as echo, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or\nabove. Short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect\nof echo can be implemented using either digital or analog methods.\n\n", "ho, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or\nabove. Short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect\nof echo can be implemented using either digital or analog methods.\n\nReverb\n\u26abReverb is short for reverberation, the effect of many sound\nreflections occurring in a very short space of time. The\nfamiliar sound of clapping in an empty hall is a good\nexample of reverb.\n\u26abReverb effects are used to restore the natural ambience to\na sound, or to give it more fullness and body.\nReverse echo\n\u26aba swelling effect created by reversing an audio signal and\nrecording echo and/or delay whilst the signal runs in\nreverse.\n\u26abWhen played back forward the last echos are heard before\nthe effected sound creating a rush like swell preceding\nand during playback.\n\n", "\nrecording echo and/or delay whilst the signal runs in\nreverse.\n\u26abWhen played back forward the last echos are heard before\nthe effected sound creating a rush like swell preceding\nand during playback.\n\nChorus\n\u26abdelayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay.\nThe delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo, but\nabove 5 ms to be audible. If the delay is too short, it will destructively\ninterfere with the un-delayed signal and create a flanging effect. Often,\nthe delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically\nconvey the effect of multiple voices.\n\u26abIt is designed to make a signal sound like it was produced by multiple\nsimilar sources.

This results in various out-of-phase interactions over time\nwhich gives the sweeping effect.\n\u26abThe signal is split, a portion is filtered with an all-pass filter to produce a phase-shift,\nand then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed.\n\u26abThe phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since\ndelays were difficult to implement with analog equipment.
