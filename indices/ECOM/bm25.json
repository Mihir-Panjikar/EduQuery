E-COMMERCE\n\uf0a1The volume of B2B transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.\n\uf0a1The primary reason for this is that in a typical supply chain there will be many B2B\ntransactions involving subcomponent or raw materials, and only one B2C transaction,\nspecifically sale of the finished product to the end customer.\n\uf0a1For example, an automobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as\nbuying tires, glass for windscreens, and rubber hoses for its vehicles.\n\uf0a1The final transaction, a finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single
