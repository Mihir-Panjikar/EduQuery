It gives \nan additional style to the HTML document. A \ncascading style sheet is a language that is \ndesigned to define the document formatting \nand look written in a markup language. \nGenerally, CSS is applied with HTML \ndocuments to change various styles of user \ninterfaces and web pages.\n\nUses of CSS\n\u2022 We can add unique styles to our old documents \nof HTML.\n\u2022 We can change the overall look and feel of our \nwebsite by following some changes in the CSS \ncode.\n\u2022 A cascading style sheet can be used with \nJavaScript and HTML in most of the websites to \ndevelop user interfaces for a lot of mobile \napplications and user interfaces for various web \napplications.", "Features of CSS\n1.\nOpportunity in Web designing: If anyone wants to begin \na career in web designing professionally, it is essential to have \nknowledge of CSS and HTML.\n1.\nWebsite Design: With the use of CSS, we can control various \nstyles, such as the text color, the font style, the spacing among \nparagraphs, column size and layout, background color and \nimages, design of the layout, display variations for distinct screens \nand device sizes, and many other effects as well.\n1.\nWeb Control: CSS has controlling power on the documents of \nHTML, so it is easy to learn.

We need to specify one rule of CSS \nfor an element and use it for every occurrence of \nthat element. So, short code means high-speed \ndownload times.\n\u2022 Easy Maintenance: To create a global alteration \nwe need to alter the style. Every element will get \nautomatically updated within all web pages.", "Cont\u2026\n\u2022 Superior HTML Styles: HTML contains few extended \nattribute\u2019s array than CSS, thus we can provide a much \nbetter view to our HTML page as compared to HTML \nattributes.\n\u2022 Save Time: We can specify CSS once and reuse the same \nsheet within various HTML pages. We can describe a style \nfor every HTML tag and apply this style to as a lot of web \npages as we want.\n\u2022 Compatibility: The cascading style sheet permits content to \nbe upgraded for one or more device types. Distinct versions \nof the website could be granted for various handheld \ndevices like cell phones and PDAs, and for printing.\n\u2022 Global Standards: Now, the attributes of HTML are being \nrecommended to apply CSS, and they are being \ndeprecated.

It helps in editing, publishing and modifying the content of the\nwebsite. i.e. A content management system (CMS) is a piece of software that\nallows users to upload and manage content online.\n\u2022\nSites such as WordPress, Jhoomla, Drupal and Wix are some examples of\nCMS's.\n\u2022\nWordPress was initially released on 27th May, 2003 by Matt Mullenweg and\nMike Little. WordPress was announced as open source in October 2009.\n\nWHY CMS SOLUTIONS?\n1. No coding knowledge required.\n2. CMS solutions allow for easy collaboration\n3.

Users don't need to worry about updates\n4. Scalability\n\nCDN versus CMS\nCMS solutions rely on CDNs. \nTo simplify it; a CDN is a network of servers that cache \ndata/content, improving load speeds and security. On the other \nhand, CMS\u2019s are pieces of software that allow users to manage \nand use their content as needed. \nA CMS may rely on a CDN to allow its users to access content and \ndata quickly but not vice versa.\nFew Examples of CDN Providers:-\nRACKSPACE, AMAZON CLOUDFRONT, MICROSOFT AZURE CDN\nGOOGLE CLOUD CDN, MAX CDN, CLOUDFLARE", "TRADITIONAL CONTENT DELIVERY \nSYSTEMS\nProblem of pushing massive amounts of data from the Internet to the \nend user as fast as possible had to be solved. \n\u2022 The first Content Delivery Networks were built by Akamai \nTechnologies, Inc. based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Their CDNs \nare responsible for 15-30% of global Internet traffic. They have over \n2200 Points of Presence in 120 countries and are affiliated with 1500 \nnetworks. \n\u2022 Companies that followed suit and also built their CDNs include \nAT&T, Telstra and Deutsche Telekom.", "TRADITIONAL CONTENT DELIVERY \nSYSTEMS ORGANISED INTO 4 PERIODS\nPre-Formation\nPeriod\n\u2022 Gave rise to server farms, hierarchical caching, and improvements \nin Web servers and caching proxy deployment\n\u2022 Infrastructure development, mirroring, caching and multihoming\nFirst \nGeneration\n\u2022CDNs focused primarily on dynamic and static content delivery\n\u2022creation and the implementation of replicas, intelligent routing and edge \ncomputing methods\n\u2022Apps and info were split across the servers.\nSecond \nGeneration\n\u2022focused on Video-on-Demand\n\u2022cleared a path for delivering content to mobile users\n\u2022credited with the usage of P2P, cloud computing techniques to delivery and \nmaintain content\n\nTRADITIONAL CONTENT DELIVERY \nSYSTEMS ORGANISED INTO 4 PERIODS\nThird \nGeneration\n\u2022driven by average users and regular individuals\n\u2022Self-configuring, self-managing\n\u2022Focus on quality of experience", "TRADITIONAL CONTENT DELIVERY \nSYSTEMS ORGANISED INTO 4 PERIODS\nThird \nGeneration\n\u2022driven by average users and regular individuals\n\u2022Self-configuring, self-managing\n\u2022Focus on quality of experience \n\nNEED FOR CONTENT ORGANIZATION\nAs more marketers publish more content, organization plays a\ngreater role. Let\u2019s say you curate 10 pieces of content a day. In a\nyear, you may easily publish more than 3,600 pieces of content.\nNow that you have such a large volume, you can provide that\ncontent to your readers in interesting ways, through intelligent\norganization.\nLet\u2019s take a look at a few outstanding ways that marketers are\norganizing their content online, with real world examples of what it\nlooks like.", "NEED FOR CONTENT ORGANIZATION\n1. Tagging\nTags are a common way to create a simple, non-hierarchical \ntaxonomy of your content. Tags are simply keywords and phrases \nthat are associated with each piece of content. For a single piece \nof content, they let the audience quickly understand the important \nconcepts captured in the content. In aggregate, they provide a \npowerful way to spot recent trends by viewing the most popular \ntags.\n\n1.

RECOMMENDATIONS\nA great way to get people to consume additional content is to offer \nrecommendations based on their previous content consumption \npatterns.\nCompanies such as Netflix and Amazon employ sophisticated \ncollaborative filtering algorithms that deliver personalized \nrecommendations to every user.\n\n3.
