A cascading style sheet is a language that is designed to define the document f o rmatting and look written in a markup language.

It is integrated with the HTML and the XHTML markup languages.\nOther Languages:\u00a0 Once we have knowledge of some basics of CSS and HTML, other associated technologies like Angular, PHP, and JavaScript are become clearer to understand.\n\n", "the XHTML markup languages.\nOther Languages:\u00a0 Once we have knowledge of some basics of CSS and HTML, other associated technologies like Angular, PHP, and JavaScript are become clearer to understand.\n\nSlide 5:\nTitle: CSS Applications\u000b\nContent: CSS Applications\nFast Page Loading:\u00a0 We don\u2019t need to mention the attributes of the HTML element every time if we use CSS. We need to specify one rule of CSS for an element and use it for every occurrence of that element.\u00a0 So, short code means high-speed download times.\nEasy Maintenance:\u00a0 To create a global alteration we need to alter the style.

We can describe a style for every HTML tag and apply this style to as a lot of web pages as we want.\nCompatibility:\u00a0 The cascading style sheet permits content to be upgraded for one or more device types. Distinct versions of the website could be granted for various handheld devices like cell phones and PDAs, and for printing.\nGlobal Standards:\u00a0 Now, the attributes of HTML are being recommended to apply CSS, and they are being deprecated.

Pages move or become obsolete, \nand navigation must follow.

It helps in editing, publishing and modifying the content of the\nwebsite. i.e. A content management system (CMS) is a piece of software that\nallows users to upload and manage content online.\n- \nSites such as WordPress, Jhoomla, Drupal and Wix are some examples of\nCMS's.\n- \nWordPress was initially released on 27th May, 2003 by Matt Mullenweg and\nMike Little.

Scalability\n\nCDN versus CMS\nCMS solutions rely on CDNs. \nTo simplify it; a CDN is a network of servers that cache \ndata/content, improving load speeds and security.
